#swap

This is a historic project from 2000, which played with ideas of semantic web, linked data, and rule languages. 
The emphasis was very much on the Web in Semantic Web - the use of an HTTP URI in a grpah was an invitation to
follow the link and look up some more graph. There is a lot of cool stuff in here, 
including *cwm*, a rule engine for N3 rules, with lots of built-in functions including crypto.
So you can build quite interesting applications just using rules.  

Also a bunch of programs for converting things into and out of RDF.

2015: The version history of the original CVS code management project has been preserved in this Github hosted git repository.
This is a target GIT repo for import of the CVS repo behind http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap, an early semantic web platform.
